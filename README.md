Save your Minecraft world backup to any storage service, such as Google Drive, automatically after the server stops.

Currently, Google Drive is the only storage service implemented, but I hope to add others, such as Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox, in the future.
I also plan to add support for backing up local single-player Minecraft worlds.

If youâ€™d like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository or submit pull requests.
